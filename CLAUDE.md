# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Onyx is a local-first, cross-platform task management app built in Rust. Tasks are stored as markdown files with YAML frontmatter in user-selected folders. The GUI uses Tauri v2 (Svelte 5 + Tailwind CSS 4) in `apps/tauri/`.

## Build & Test Commands

```bash
cargo build                        # Build all crates
cargo build -p onyx-cli      # Build CLI only
cargo test                         # Run all tests
cargo test -p onyx-core      # Run core library tests only
cargo run -p onyx-cli -- <args>  # Run CLI with arguments

# Tauri GUI
cd apps/tauri && npm install       # Install frontend dependencies
WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1 npm run tauri dev  # Run Tauri in dev mode (Wayland)
npm run tauri build                # Build for production
```

The CLI binary is named `onyx` (from the `onyx-cli` crate).

The Tauri dev server runs on port 1422 (`vite.config.ts` and `tauri.conf.json`).

## Architecture

Two-crate workspace (`resolver = "2"`, edition 2021) plus a Tauri app:

- **onyx-core** — Pure Rust library. Storage trait with `FileSystemStorage` implementation, `TaskRepository` (main API), data models, config, error types. No CLI/UI dependencies. `keyring` feature-gated behind `keyring-storage` (default on) for Android compatibility.
- **onyx-cli** — CLI frontend using clap. Commands are in `src/commands/` (init, workspace, list, task, group). Output formatting in `src/output.rs`.
- **apps/tauri/** — Tauri v2 GUI. Svelte 5 frontend in `src/`, Rust backend in `src-tauri/` with Tauri commands that call into `onyx-core`. `notify` crate feature-gated for Android. `tauri-plugin-credentials/` provides cross-platform credential storage (Android Keystore via EncryptedSharedPreferences, desktop via keyring crate).

### Key patterns

- **Storage trait** (`storage.rs`): Strategy pattern for task persistence. `FileSystemStorage` reads/writes markdown files with YAML frontmatter and JSON metadata files. Atomic writes (temp file + rename, with temp cleanup on failure) for all metadata files. Input validation: task titles max 500 chars, descriptions max 1MB, list names max 255 chars, YAML frontmatter max 64KB. Delete operations update metadata before removing files to prevent orphaned metadata on crash.
- **Repository** (`repository.rs`): `TaskRepository` wraps a `Storage` impl and provides the public API for task/list CRUD, ordering, and grouping. Tests live here.
- **Config** (`config.rs`): `AppConfig` manages workspaces keyed by UUID string. `WorkspaceConfig` stores `name`, `path`, `mode` (Local/Webdav), `webdav_url`, `webdav_path` (user-selected remote folder), `theme`, and `sync_interval_secs`. `add_workspace` returns a generated UUID. Stored in platform-specific config dirs via the `directories` crate. Atomic writes (temp file + rename) prevent corruption on crash.
- **Sync** (`sync.rs`): Three-way diff sync with offline queue. File-based `.sync.lock` prevents concurrent sync operations (auto-cleaned after 5 minutes if stale). Checksum-based conflict resolution: downloads remote, compares SHA-256 — identical content is a false conflict (skipped); when different, remote wins and local is recovered as a duplicate with a new UUID and `[RECOVERED FROM CONFLICT]` prefix (duplicate file cleaned up if metadata update fails). Auto-sync lifecycle: periodic polling (configurable interval, default 60s), debounced file-change (5s), window-focus (30s stale threshold). Wrapped in `tokio::time::timeout` (60s) to handle unreachable servers on Windows. Path traversal validation rejects `..` components and backslashes anywhere in sync paths. Atomic writes for sync state and queue files (temp cleanup on failure).
- **WebDAV** (`webdav.rs`): reqwest client with rustls-tls, 30s request timeout, 10s connect timeout. Rejects non-HTTPS URLs. `Zeroizing<String>` for credential fields. `move_resource` method for WebDAV MOVE (workspace rename). 10MB cap on both PROPFIND responses and file downloads. Desktop credentials via `keyring` crate (feature-gated); Tauri GUI uses `tauri-plugin-credentials` for cross-platform support (Android Keystore + desktop keychain).

### On-disk format

Workspaces are plain folders. Each task list is a subfolder containing `.listdata.json` (metadata/ordering) and one `.md` file per task. The workspace root has `.onyx-workspace.json` for list ordering and workspace detection. Sync only processes files at expected depths: `.onyx-workspace.json` at root, `.listdata.json` and `*.md` inside list directories. Task frontmatter contains `id`, `status`, `version` (u64, increments via `saturating_add` on every write, defaults to 1 for legacy files), and optionally `due`, `has_time`, `parent` (omitted when false/null). `list_tasks` auto-deduplicates by UUID, keeping the highest-version file and deleting stale copies; when versions are equal, filesystem modification time is used as a tiebreaker.

### Tauri GUI structure

The GUI uses Svelte 5 runes mode (`$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`, `$props()`). Key UI patterns:

- **Sliding drawer**: Left panel (lists) slides with main content as one piece via `translateX`. 80cqi wide (80% container query inline size). List items show checkmark for active list and chevron on hover.
- **Three-panel slide**: Main content area is 300% wide with three panels (task list, task detail, subtask detail) that slide via `translateX` using a `taskStack` array. Stack depth 0 = list, 1 = task detail, 2 = subtask detail.
- **Settings modal**: Per-workspace settings opened from workspace kebab menu. Shows WebDAV config (for webdav workspaces), sync controls, and theme selector.
- **Workspace switcher**: Custom drop-up menu in drawer footer (left), kebab menu per workspace (right) with Settings option.
- **Task animations**: Grid-rows `0fr`/`1fr` trick for smooth collapse/expand. Module-level `animateInIds` Set coordinates expand-in after toggle.
- **Inline editing**: Click task to edit, auto-save on blur. `debouncedSave` snapshots task before timer to prevent stale-reference errors on component destroy.
- **Kebab menus**: Tasks and lists use kebab menus with custom `ConfirmDialog` component (not native `confirm()`). "Move to..." is inline in the menu (not a submenu) to avoid overflow.
- **Main panel header**: Hamburger + window controls in top bar; list name (large, bold) + kebab below divider (matching task detail layout). Kebab has Rename, Group by due date, Delete completed, Delete list.
- **New task**: FAB button opens bottom toast sheet (outside sliding container for fixed positioning).

### Development phase

Pre-alpha. No users, no released builds, no data to migrate. Breaking changes to on-disk formats, config structure, or sync conventions are free — do not add migration logic.

### Current state (2026-04-06)

- **Phase 1** (Core + CLI): Complete
- **Phase 2** (WebDAV sync): Complete — remote folder browsing, checksum-based conflict resolution, auto-sync lifecycle, per-workspace sync interval
- **Phase 3** (GUI MVP): Complete
- **Phase 4** (Mobile): In progress — Android preliminaries done (file-watcher gating, tauri-plugin-credentials, safe area insets, Android targets configured); needs build verification and iOS setup
